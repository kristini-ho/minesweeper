			<strong>How to Play</strong></p>
		<p>
			The objective of Minesweeper is to clear a minefield without detonating a mine.</p>
		<p>
			A grid of squares is presented to the player. Some squares contain mines&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://img.informer.com/icons/png/32/351/351072.png" style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" />&nbsp;while other squares do not. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The content of a square is revealed by left-clicking. If the player reveals a mine, the player loses the game. If the player reveals a square without a mine, the square displays a number representing the number of mines neighboring the square (top, bottom, left, right, and diagonals included). Squares with zero mines neighboring them are blank when revealed and cause surrounding squares to be revealed until number-displaying squares form a border around an island of blank squares.</p>
		<p>
			The player can mark mine-containing squares with a flag&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://dougx.net/sweeper/flag.png" style="width: 20px; height: 20px;" />&nbsp;by right-clicking. The player wins when all the number-displaying squares have been revealed successfully.</p>
		<p>
			A new game can be started by clicking the smiley face &nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://princessleia.com/images/minesweeper/pros.png" style="width: 40px; height: 39px;" /> .&nbsp;</p>
